Do you want to dive into data science and artificial intelligence research but have no programming experience? You are probably willing to study all the necessary literature and take several courses but don't know where to start from? Then, this article is for you. 

In this piece of writing, I will list and explain some resources to help you get started with programming and to eventually meetup with current issues in artificial intelligence.   

The material listed in this blog might not be the best out there, but this is what I used to bridge the gap between the me who could not write a single line of computer code and the me today, who is able to speak the same language as fellow AI researchers. 

I must admit, I am still a novice in this fied as I will keep exploiting new resources to make myself better. But, the resources mentioned in this course are enough to give you the confidence you need to pursue AI research and datascience in general.  

First and foremost, every data science project is done using a programming language. Most of the resources in this article are based on the python programming language which I believe is the best programming language for datascience and AI reearch.  

To move from zero level programming to being comfortable with machine learning and deep learning, the following resources will help you get started: 

1. Python 3 Programming Coursera Specialization 
2. Machine Learning free Coursera course 
3. AI for Everyone Coursera course 
4. Deep learning Coursera Specialization 
5. AI for Medicine Coursera Specialization 
6. Work on a real world AI based project 

I will give details about each of these resources in the following paragraphs. Note, these resources are only courses. You will need to find the related literature by yourself if you wanna go deeper into each topic. 

First and foremost, all of these courses are hosted on the Coursera platform at [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/). Coursera is an excellent learning platform where you can find both free and paid courses. All but one of the courses listed in this post are paid courses (about 49 US dolars per month). 

Before you get discouraged, I have some good news for you. You can take all those courses for free and earn a course completion certificate by applying for financial aid. Oh yes financial aid.Coursera offers financial aid to students who can't afford to pay for a course or a course completion certificate. This means you are 100% guanranteed to take courses, specializations and professional certificates and earn a certicate. All you need to do is apply.

1.[Python 3 Programming Coursera Specialization by the University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming?).   

This specialization is made of five(5) courses properly arranged to help students progress in python from zero to intermediate/mastery. Here is the order in which I took the courses and I find it very useful: Python Basics; Python functions, files and dictionaries; Data collection and processing with python ; Python classes and inheritance; and Python project: pillow, tesseract and open cv 

1.1. [Python Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics?specialization=python-3-programming)   

In this course, you will learn the basics of python3 programming, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures. You'll program an on-screen Turtle to draw pretty pictures. You'll also learn to draw reference diagrams as a way to reason about program executions, which will help to build up your debugging skills. The course has no prerequisites. It will cover Chapters 1-9 of the textbook "Fundamentals of Python Programming," which is the accompanying text (optional and free) for this course. I recommend you make use of the textbook. It will help you get fluent faster.

This is the first of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

1.2. [Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-functions-files-dictionaries?specialization=python-3-programming)     

This course introduces the dictionary data structure and user-defined functions. You’ll learn about local and global variables, optional and keyword parameter-passing, named functions and lambda expressions. You’ll also learn about Python’s sorted function and how to control the order in which it sorts by passing in another function as an input. For your final project, you’ll read in simulated social media data from a file, compute sentiment scores, and write out .csv files. It covers chapters 10-16 of the textbook “Fundamentals of Python Programming”.

This is a follow-up to the "Python Basics" course (course 1 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization), and it is the second of five courses in the specialization.

The course is well-suited for you if you have already taken the "Python Basics" course and want to gain further fundamental knowledge of the Python language. Together, both courses are geared towards newcomers to Python programming, those who need a refresher on Python basics, or those who may have had some exposure to Python programming but want a more in-depth exposition and vocabulary for describing and reasoning about programs.
