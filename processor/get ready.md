Do you want to dive into data science and artificial intelligence (AI) research but have no programming experience? You are probably willing to study all the necessary literature and take several courses but don't know where to start from? Then, this article is for you. 

In this piece of writing, I will list and explain some resources to help you get started with programming and to eventually meetup with current issues in artificial intelligence.   

The material listed in this blog might not be the best out there, but this is what I used to bridge the gap between the me who could not write a single line of computer code and the me today, who is able to speak the same language as fellow AI researchers. 

I must admit, I am still a novice in this fied as I myself keeps learning something new each day. But, the resources mentioned in this post are enough to give you the confidence you need to pursue AI research and datascience in general.  

Most of the resources in this article are based on the python programming language which I believe is the best programming language for datascience and AI reearch. Feel free to exploit other programming languages if you wish.

To move from zero level programming to being comfortable with machine learning and deep learning, the following resources will help you get started: 

1. Python 3 Programming Coursera Specialization 
2. Machine Learning free Coursera course 
3. AI for Everyone Coursera course 
4. Deep learning Coursera Specialization 
5. AI for Medicine Coursera Specialization 
6. Work on a real world AI based project 

I will give details about each of these resources in the following paragraphs. Note, these resources are only courses. You will need to find the related literature by yourself if you wanna go deeper into each topic. 

First and foremost, all of these courses are hosted on the Coursera platform at [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/). Coursera is an excellent learning platform where you can find both free and paid courses. All but one of the courses listed in this post are paid courses (about 49 US dolars per month). 

Before you get discouraged, I have some good news for you. You can take all those courses for free and earn a course completion certificate by applying for financial aid. Oh yes financial aid.Coursera offers financial aid to students who can't afford to pay for a course or a course completion certificate. This means that you are 100% guanranteed to take courses, specializations and professional certificates and earn a certicate. All you need to do is apply for the coursera scholarship.

1.[Python 3 Programming Coursera Specialization by the University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming?).   

![image tooltip here](/images/python3.png)

This specialization is made of five(5) courses properly arranged to help students progress in python from zero to intermediate/mastery. Here is the order in which I took the courses and I find it very useful: Python Basics; Python functions, files and dictionaries; Data collection and processing with python ; Python classes and inheritance; and Python project: pillow, tesseract and open cv 

1.1. [Python Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics?specialization=python-3-programming)   

![image tooltip here](/images/python_basics_shot.png)

In this course, you will learn the basics of python3 programming, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures. You'll program an on-screen Turtle to draw pretty pictures. You'll also learn to draw reference diagrams as a way to reason about program executions, which will help to build up your debugging skills. The course has no prerequisites. It will cover Chapters 1-9 of the textbook "Fundamentals of Python Programming," which is the accompanying text (optional and free) for this course. I recommend you make use of the textbook. It will help you get fluent faster.

This is the first of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

1.2. [Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-functions-files-dictionaries?specialization=python-3-programming)     

![image tooltip here](/images/python_functions.png)

This course introduces the dictionary data structure and user-defined functions. You’ll learn about local and global variables, optional and keyword parameter-passing, named functions and lambda expressions. You’ll also learn about Python’s sorted function and how to control the order in which it sorts by passing in another function as an input. For your final project, you’ll read in simulated social media data from a file, compute sentiment scores, and write out .csv files. It covers chapters 10-16 of the textbook “Fundamentals of Python Programming”.

This is a follow-up to the "Python Basics" course (course 1 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization), and it is the second of five courses in the specialization.

The course is well-suited for you if you have already taken the "Python Basics" course and want to gain further fundamental knowledge of the Python language. Together, both courses are geared towards newcomers to Python programming, those who need a refresher on Python basics, or those who may have had some exposure to Python programming but want a more in-depth exposition and vocabulary for describing and reasoning about programs.

1.3. [Data Collection and Processing with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-collection-processing-python?specialization=python-3-programming)  


![image tooltip here](/images/data_collection.png)

This course teaches you to fetch and process data from services on the Internet. It covers Python list comprehensions and provides opportunities to practice extracting from and processing deeply nested data. You'll also learn how to use the Python requests module to interact with REST APIs and what to look for in documentation of those APIs. For the final project, you will construct a “tag recommender” for the flickr photo sharing site.

The course is well-suited for you if you have already taken the "Python Basics" and "Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries" courses (courses 1 and 2 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization). If you are already familiar with Python fundamentals but want practice at retrieving and processing complex nested data from Internet services, you can also benefit from this course without taking the previous two.

This is the third of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

1.4 [Python Classes and Inheritance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-classes-inheritance?specialization=python-3-programming)   

![image tooltip here](/images/python_classes.png)

This course introduces classes, instances, and inheritance. You will learn how to use classes to represent data in concise and natural ways. You'll also learn how to override built-in methods and how to create "inherited" classes that reuse functionality. You'll also learn about how to design classes. Finally, you will be introduced to the good programming habit of writing automated tests for their own code.

The course is best-suited for you if you are already familiar with Python fundamentals, which are covered in the "Python Basics" and "Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries" courses (courses 1 and 2 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization). It is optional to have taken the "Data Collection and Processing with Python" course (course 3 of the specialization), but knowledge of retrieving and processing complex nested data is helpful.

This is the fourth of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.


1.5 [Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project?specialization=python-3-programming)  

![image tooltip here](/images/python_project.png)

This course will walk you through a hands-on project suitable for a portfolio. You will be introduced to third-party APIs and will be shown how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library. By the end of the course you will have worked with three different libraries available for Python 3 to create a real-world data-analysis project.

The course is best-suited for learners who have taken the first four courses of the Python 3 Programming Specialization. Learners who already have Python programming skills but want to practice with a hands-on, real-world data-analysis project can also benefit from this course.

This is the fifth and final course in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
