Do you want to dive into data science and artificial intelligence research but have no programming experience? You are probably willing to study all the necessary literature and take several courses but don't know where to start from? Then, this article is for you. 

In this piece of writing, I will list and explain some resources to help you get started with programming and to eventually meetup with current issues in artificial intelligence.    
The material listed in this blog might not be the best out there, but this is what I used to bridge the gap between the me who could not write a single line of computer code and the me today, who is able to speak the same language as fellow AI researchers. 

I must admit, I am still a novice in this fied as I will keep exploiting new resources to make myself better. But, the resources mentioned in this course are enough to give you the confidence you need to pursue AI research.  

First and foremost, every data science project is done using a programming language. Most of the resources in this article are based on the python programming language which I believe is the best programming language for AI reearch.  

To move from zero level programming to being comfortable with machine learning and deep learning, the following resources will help you get started: 

1. Python 3 Programming Coursera Specialization 
2. Machine Learning free Coursera course 
3. AI for Everyone Coursera course 
4. Deep learning Coursera Specialization 
5. AI for Medicine Coursera Specialization 
6. Work on a real world AI based project
