We now live in a society where many advanced technologies are being produced every year. Some of these adavnced technologies are DNA sequencing machines. These machines take in purified and amplified DNA and produce a sequence of ACGT characters.  

Each character in the sequence represents a specific nucleotide. So, what exactly do we do with these DNA sequences? We need to extract important information such as the number genes in a specific location, the replication origin, the type of genes and so on. 

In this article, I will show you how you can use simple python codes to find all genes from a DNA sequence, but first, I will like to define some useful terminologies.

1. Nucleotide: Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA just like amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. 
4. Codon:
5. Gene:
6. Start codon:
7. Stop codon:
8. genome:
9. double strand:
10. single: strand: 
11. Complementary base pairing:
