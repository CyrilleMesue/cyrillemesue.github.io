We now live in a society where many advanced technologies are being produced every year. Some of these adavnced technologies are DNA sequencing machines. These machines take in purified and amplified DNA and produce a sequence of ACGT characters.  

Each character in the sequence represents a specific nucleotide. So, what exactly do we do with these DNA sequences? We need to extract important information such as the number genes in a specific location, the replication origin, the type of genes and so on. 

In this article, I will show you how you can use simple python codes to find all genes from a DNA sequence, but first, I will like to define some useful terminologies.

1. Nitrogenous base:
2. Nucleotide:
3. Codon:
4. Gene:
5. Start codon:
6. Stop codon:
7. genome:
8. double strand:
9. single: strand: 
10. Complementary base pairing:
11.
