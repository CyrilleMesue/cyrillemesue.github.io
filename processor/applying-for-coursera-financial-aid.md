Coursera is so far the most successful online learning platform. It has helped millions of students and workers groom their skills in many areas through its high quality courses provided by many different prestigious universities. Coursera also offers financial aid to students who cannot afford to pay for a course or course certificate. 

In this article, I will show you the simple steps for applying for financial aid on Coursera. 

Note: Coursera offers financial aid for courses, specializations and professional certificates only. Guided projects and Master track certificates are not covered with a financial aid application. 

Without wasting any time, let's hit the nail on its head.

This is to ensure that your correct information appear on your coursera certificates.
