Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am a Bioengineering Student at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. As an aspiring Bioengineer, I aim to utilize machine learning, deep learning, medical imaging and bioengineering techniques to make a positive impact in global healthcare. I'm also interested in the applications of computational and Systems Biology in understandding the pathophysiology of cancer.  

I am a self-taught datascientist and systems biologist and intend to use my deeplearning knowledge for medical imaging, and my systems biology knowledge in cancer drug design. I enjoy gathering, organizing and analyzing information, working in groups and contributing to project strategies.       

## Vision  
* To be part of new breakthroughs in medical diagnosis, prognosis and companion diagnosis, as well as advancements in biomedical research. 
* To be part of great Innovation in biomedical technologies.  
* To contribute to the making of a healthier world.
