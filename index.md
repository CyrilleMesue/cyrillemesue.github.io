Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am a Bioengineering Student at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. As an aspiring Bioengineer, I aim to utilize machine learning, Medical Imaging and Bioengineering techniques to make a positive impact in global healthcare. I enjoy gathering, organizing and analyzing information, working in groups and contributing to project strategies. I'm also interested in the applications of computational and Systems Biology in the pathophysiology of cancer.
