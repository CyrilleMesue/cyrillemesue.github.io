Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am a Bioengineering Student at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. As an aspiring Bioengineer, I aim to utilize machine learning, Medical Imaging and Bioengineering techniques to make a positive impact in global healthcare. I'm also interested in the applications of computational and Systems Biology in the pathophysiology of cancer.  

I am a self-taught datascientist and systems biologist and intend to use my deeplearning knowledge for medical imaging, and my systems biology knowledge in cancer drug design. I enjoy gathering, organizing and analyzing information, working in groups and contributing to project strategies.    

### Mission  
My mission for this is site is to:  
* make a positive impact in the lives of many young students by sharing educative content.
* make connections with intellects who have a common interest as me.
* build a team of individuals who are eager to build a better world.
* create an opportunity for learners, including myself, to continuously acquire knowledge.
* Raise awareness of various technological advances for medical applications.
* Showcase my skills and Achievements.    

### Vision  
* Be part of new breakthroughs in medical diagnosis, prognosis and companion diagnosis, as well as advancements in biomedical research. 
* Be part of great Innovation in biomedical technologies.  
* Contribute to the making of a healthier world.

### Hobbies  
* Singing gospel songs during my free time gives me more joy than any other hobby.I am hoping that one day God will also use me through my voice to bless others. My voice is very far from being the best, but I keep singing because singing gives me joy and I hope to improve my voice day by day through persistent practice.
* Reading books. 
> “Once you stop learning, you start dying” –Albert Einstein.     
Everyone knows this is true. We just don't wanna accept it. But without knowledge, its hard to survive in this complex world.
* Sports. Doing sports is now part of my morning routine. This is something I have experimented on. I tend to live a happier day the days I exercise in the morning than the days I do not. It works for me, it might work for you as well. 
* Movies. I got a taste for Mount Zion gospel movies, and technology-oriented superhero tv shows such as "The Flash", as well as supernatural TV shows.
