Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am  Bioengineering Student at Yildiz Technical University. As an aspiring Bioengineer, I aim to utilize machine learning, Medical Imaging and Bioengineering techniques to make a positive impact in global healthcare. I enjoy gathering, organizing and analyzing information, working in groups and contributing to project strategies. I'm also interested in the application of computational biology and Systems Biology in the field of Pathology.

Through this site, I hope to meet and raise a community of individuals who will offer each other the opportunity to learn and grow. While my main focus is in Biomedical research, I am opening to learning new things as I believe that knowledge is the best food for our brains. I value your comments more than any thing as my primary goal is to learn. 

Through this portfolio site, I will share with you some of the courses I have taken online, interesting books(Probably make summaries), Some data science tutorials, especially those that gave me headache and any other information I think is worth sharing. 

To view the courses I have taken so far, click [here](https://cyrillemesue.github.io/Courses/).

I will summarise most of my completed datascience projects on [github](https://github.com/CyrilleMesue)
