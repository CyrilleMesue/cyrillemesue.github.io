Hello, my name is Cyrille. I am from the south west region of Cameroon,bit currently residing in Istanbul, Turkey. I major in Bioengineering in the Chemical and Metallurgical Faculty of Yıldız Technical University, Istanbul.

Through this site, I hope to meet and raise a community of individuals who will offer each other the opportunity to learn and grow. While my main focus is in Biomedical research, I am opening to learning new things as I believe that knowledge is the best food for our brains.

I will use this platform for my blogs and to showcase some of my works and I believe I will learn a lot through your comments.
