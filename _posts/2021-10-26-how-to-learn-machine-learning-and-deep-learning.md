Do you want to dive into data science and artificial intelligence (AI) research? Do do you want to apply some AI concepts in your field to boost your productivity? You are probably willing to study all the necessary literature and take several courses but donâ€™t know where to start from? Then, this article is for you.
Just about a year ago, I was in your exact shoes. I started off by crashing the surface of the python programming language with a few courses on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), then I gradually started to dive deeper into data science where I eventually found fun learning machine learning and deep learning.   

In this article, I will list and explain some resources to help you get started with programming and to eventually meetup with current issues in machine learning and deep learning.
The material listed in this blog might not be the best out there, but this is what I used to bridge the gap between the me who could not write a single line of computer code and the me today who is able to speak almost the same language as other AI experts.
I want to make it clear that following the material listed in this article will not make you a machine learning nor a deep learning expert. But, I believe you will have the confidence you need to pursue AI research or simply to apply state-of-the art deep learning models in your domain.
Most of the resources in this article are based on the python programming language which I believe is the best programming language for data science and AI research. Feel free to exploit other programming languages if you wish.
Here is a brief summary of the resources I will be discussing in this post, listed under five headings:

1. Python 3 programming coursera specialization  
2. Machine learning Free coursera course
3. Deep learning coursera specialization
4. AI for Medicine coursera specialization
5. Work on a real world AI based project

I will give details about each of these resources in the following paragraphs. Note, these resources are only courses. You will need to find the related literature by yourself if you wanna go deeper into each topic.
