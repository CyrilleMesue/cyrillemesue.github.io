The outbreak of Covid-19 has led to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system of almost every individual for a prolonged time and this has resulted in panic and stress one way or another. As an act to level the epidemic curve of the virus, many nations implemented a national lockdown to enhance social distancing. While some nations have fully resumed their economic and social activities, others are still in a mild or severe lockdown period. Below is a summary of guides to help you escape from a panic mode to a stress-free and relaxed mode during a pandemic and lockdown period. The points listed below are adopted from Professor Steve Joordens, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto, through his course “Mind Control: Managing Your Mental Health During COVID-19” on Coursera. Professor Steve is an experienced professor who got me captured through his 3-hour course on Coursera. Professor Steve expatriates well on this topic and I recommend you click the link below and watch his course on Coursera.

Before knowing how to get rid of stress, I would love to let us know that stress has a detrimental effect on the immune system. Now is the time to have an optimum immune system. However, when we allow stress upon our immune system by worrying so much about the virus, our immune system is suppressed. So, it is very important to find ways to get rid of stress. Remember, health is both physical, mental and psychological well being. So, I strongly recommend you implement the following points to maintain your mental and psychological health during a pandemic.

Spend less time watching Covid news. Each time we watch covid news or news that relays information that affects our emotions negatively, we get constantly reminded of the thread(Coronavirus) in place. These checked emotions energize us with anxiety which in turns leads to stress. Therefore we should reduce our news consumption to between 2 and 3 hours per day. (“Watch, but budget, your news consumption ... and when possible follow it with a palette cleanser” by Prof Steve Joordens)
Do not watch the news within two hours of going to sleep. This is because you may get worried and the next thing is sleeping with all the worries( a sympathetic state). The body needs to be in a parasympathetic(relaxed) state during sleep so as to correctly carry out long term vital mechanisms such as digestion, growth, tissue repair and so on.
Eat enough fruits and vegetables. Make sure you eat healthy meals as well and as plenty as you can.
Keep yourself busy. Never stay idle as. Visit websites for service development take massive open online courses and attend webinars. There are several websites such as LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Edx, Udacity, Udemy, Alison and so on, from where you can take many courses and build your skills.
Take your mind off the stressful thoughts by doing one or more of your hobbies in a relaxed mode such as watching Sports games and TV programs, playing games, listening to music, dancing, eating, or doing something that makes you smile, etc
Consider that what WHO refers to as “Social distancing” is rather a “Physical distancing” because now is the time you need to increase your social relationships. The virus does not spread through a social network. So, make good use of your social media.
Lough and smile as often as possible. This will help relieve both you and the people who see you smile, from stress.
Family and friends are crucial. Share your anxiety with them. It will draw you into a relaxed state.
When using social media, choose video calls over text and emojis. These are better equipped to communicate our emotions more efficiently to our friends and family.
Establish new rituals (Wake up and go to bed at a particular time, Have your meals at roughly the same times daily).
keep a regular daily schedule.
Learn how to release tension from your body, through meditation.
For more information, I strongly recommend you take the “Mind Control: Managing Your Mental Health During COVID-19” course on Coursera.
