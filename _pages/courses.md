I visit many online learning platforms for learning, but Coursera is where I stabilize. However, you might have a different taste for a particular platform. I prefer Coursera because most of the courses have a video-lecture-to-practice-questions-to-project nature. 

You might be worried about affording the course, but some of these courses are free. Also, many study platforms offer financial aid or a low pay rate premium subscription to students for paid courses.  

Below is a link to access the catalogue of some of the helpful MOOC platforms I know.
