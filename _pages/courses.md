I visit many online learning platforms for learning, but Coursera is where I stabilize. However, you might have a different taste for a particular platform. I prefer coursera because most of the courses have a video-lecture-to-practice-questions-to-project nature. 

You might be worrying about affording the course, but some of these couses are free and many of the study platforms out there offer financial aid or a low pay rate premium subscription to students for paid courses.

Below is a link to the main catalog of some of the helpful MOOC platforms I know.
