I visit many online learning platforms for learning, but Coursera is where I stabilize. However, you might have a different taste for a particular platform. I prefer coursera because most of the courses have a video lecture to practice questions to project nature. 

You might be worrying about how to afford the course, but some of these couses are free and many of the study platforms out there offer financial aid or a low pay rate premium subscription to students.
