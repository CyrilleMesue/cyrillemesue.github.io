I am a self-disciplined Bioengineering student, interested in Advanced medical technologies and AI, as well as their application for medical Diagnosis, Prognosis and Companion Diagnosis. I'm also interested in the application of computational biology and Systems Biology in the field of Pathology.   

### Mission  
My mission for is site is to:  
* make a positive impact in the lives of many young students by sharing educative content.
* make connections with intellects who have a common interest as me.

* Raise awareness of various technological advances for medical applications.
* Showcase my skills and Achievements.    

### Vision  
* Be part of an evolution in medical technologies(including AI) that will result in accurate medical diagnostics, prognostics and companion diagnostics, and advancements in biomedical research. 
* Make connections with great developers and endeavor to become one of them.
* Bring Technology Innovation to the heart of the underdeveloped world.   
  
### Slogan 
* We can all tap into infinite intelligence that God has installed in us. However, we need to first believe.

### Interest  
  * Biomedical Research
  * Digital Pathology
  * Medical Imaging
  * Biomedical Technologies
  * Machine Learning and Deep Learning
  * Systems Biology
  * Music
  
### Hobbies  
* Singing gospel songs during my free time gives me more joy than any other hobby.I am hoping that one day God will also use me through my voice to bless others. My voice is very far from being the best, but I keep singing because singing gives me joy and I hope to improve my voice day by day through persistent practice.
* Reading books. 
> “Once you stop learning, you start dying” –Albert Einstein.   
Everyone knows this is true. We just don't wanna accept it. But without knowledge, its hard to survive in this complex world.
* Sports. Doing sports is now part of my morning routine. This is something I have experimented on. I tend to live a happier day the days I exercise in the morning than the days I do not. It works for me, it might work for you as well. 
* Movies. I got a taste for Mount Zion gospel movies, and technology-oriented superhero tv shows such as "The Flash".
