Below are some projects I completed or participated in.  

### Project 01 | Teknofest AI in Healthcare Competition
MARCH 2021- SEPTEMBER 2021   

In this project, the task was to create a deep learning model and can identify areas of the brain that show signs of stroke; ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, in brain CT  images. We built both a classification model to tell if an image has stroke or not, and, a segmentation model to mark pixels in the brain CT scan where the stroke is found. 

We used transfer learning and ensembling to perform the task and our team was ranked number 16 out of 53 teams that got to the final stage and 257 teams that registered.
